# plex-reminder
Im designing a program for my computer that parses the metadata sent from my plex server in regards to the media that is being added to the library.
By utilitizing a webhook listener the program will send notifications to an android application on my smartphone which alerts me to when a new episode 
or movie is added to the server.
